** Followed ROS tuto on docker: https://hub.docker.com/_/ros/
** ping android to/from ubuntu on aws
- install ZeroTier
  curl -s https://install.zerotier.com/ | bash
- create ZeroTier account, create new network
- check IPV4 auto-assign
zerotier-cli join 565799d8f6f7f87f 
- install ZeroTier on Android, join network
- On the Website https://my.zerotier.com/network/565799d8f6f7f87f, check 'auth' on each member, and give them a good name
- let's ping
  ping 10.242.58.128 # from ubuntu
  ping 10.242.116.228 # from android
** ROS pub/sub from android to ubuntu
*** Android:
- Run local master node
- use auto IP address
 
*** Ubuntu:
docker run -it --rm  --name master ros:indigo-perception bash
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://10.242.58.128:11311
rostopic list
# /camera/compressed !!!
#docker run --expose 11311 -it --rm     --net foo     --name master     ros:ros-tutorials     roscore
rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/compressed
# Doesn't work !! Docker must use X11
** Image view from a docker image
http://toddsampson.com/post/131965350342/ros-visualization-packages-in-docker
mkdir -p ~/ros/image-view
vim Dockerfile
docker build --tag ros:indigo-image-pipeline .
vim docker-compose.yml
# Paste website's compose and change ROS_MASTER_URI

*** TODO does not work !! Try another docker image that runs firefox: http://fabiorehm.com/blog/2014/09/11/running-gui-apps-with-docker/

  - got some trouble with Ubuntu running from NoMachine: it is hanging
  - it could have been caused by the disk being full at some point yesterday, or by ros writing to X, or by the hostname renaming ?
  - recreated a new machine from snapshot with 20Gb
  - re-installed ZeroTier
  - Ran ros-image-pipeline/docker-compose up => displays an X Window, but no image :-(
  - this works:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  docker build -t ros-image-pipeline .
  docker run -it --rm -e ROS_MASTER_URI=http://10.242.58.128:11311 ros-image-pipeline 
  rostopic list
  #+END_SRC
  - next step: investigate network issues: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/NetworkSetup
